•	Developed an Emotion Detection system using Python that can detect emotions from three sources: face, text, and audio.

•	Utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning models to analyze facial expressions and recognize emotions from faces.

•	Implements Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process and analyze textual data, predicting emotions from written content.

•	Utilizes audio processing and machine learning algorithms to recognize emotions from audio recordings.

•	Offers a user-friendly interface for users to input images, text, or audio and receive emotion predictions.

•	The project demonstrates the power of multi-modal Emotion Detection, enabling comprehensive emotion analysis from different sources.

•	Provides practical applications in sentiment analysis, emotion recognition in customer feedback, and mood monitoring in voice-based applications.

•	Showcases your proficiency in Python programming, computer vision, NLP, and audio processing.
